#! Tachyon (Posts)

Tachyon leverages the post API in the toolbox.  

+ **Commands** are orders, must be done unless it's impossible (ie, load a non-existent file)
+ **Events** are things that happened (ie inputs).
+ **Replies** are acknowledgemtn to requests
+ **Requests** can be conditional commands, can be refused for other grounds (ie, close() but there's unsaved data, inquiry t the user that gets canceled).  OR, they can be requests for information (see replies)
